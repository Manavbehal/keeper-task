# Keeper App

Welcome to Keeper App! This is my first React application, built for keeping and managing notes. This project encouraged me to dive deep into learning react, helping me get familiar with JSX code practice. I learnt about react props, conditional rendering, react hooks, event handeling, react forms, changing complex states, managing component tree, and much more! Deploying this application on github pages was quite challenging as a first timer, but overall great learning experience.
